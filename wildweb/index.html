            Around 4.6 billion people use the internet every day. In fact, 350,000 tweets have been sent in the past minute. We tend to think of the internet as something ephemeral – partly thanks to terms like “web” and “cloud” – but the servers that host all that data produce huge amounts of emissions, leaving giant carbon footprints behind.

At first, I was terrified, but then I noticed it was just focusing on eating berries, roots, even fish. It was like it couldn't get enough food. <br><br>I was shocked by the bear's behavior. Why was it eating so much? Was it sick? Luckily, it didn’t notice me. </div>
