            Around 4.6 billion people use the internet every day. In fact, 350,000 tweets have been sent in the past minute. We tend to think of the internet as something ephemeral – partly thanks to terms like “web” and “cloud” – but the servers that host all that data produce huge amounts of emissions, leaving giant carbon footprints behind.

                    <div class="smalltext white"> During the fall months, bears eat and drink nearly nonstop. They need to put on weight to prepare for winter and hibernation. This process is called hyperphagia. During hyperphagia, bears are very active and many visitors have a chance to see them in action. This extraordinary eating frenzy helps them build the fat reserves necessary to survive the long months of hibernation.<br><br>
                    Bears take this winter break to conserve energy due to the lack of food available during cold temperatures.They truly shut down, completely resetting the parameters of their daily lives. They go in, turn around two or three times, lie down, and stay that way for six months. They only get up to switch sides every few days.

                        The increasing reliance on digital devices has led to a notable rise in global energy consumption. Observing the energy-saving behaviors of bears during hibernation has provided me with valuable insights for managing digital device energy consumption. This report examines the energy conservation practices of bears and how these principles can be applied to reduce the energy consumption of our digital devices.<br><br>

                        Bears hibernate mainly because food becomes scarce during the winter. As temperatures drop, food sources become limited, making it challenging for bears to sustain themselves. To survive this period, bears enter hibernation, reducing their metabolic rate and conserving energy.  bears achieve substantial energy savings by reducing their bodily functions to minimal levels. A bear’s heart rate drops from about 50 beats per minute to as low as 8. Their metabolic rate decreases by 50-60%, allowing them to live off their fat reserves for several months.<br><br>
                        
                        Just like bears hibernate when food is scarce, we can treat our energy use the same way with our digital devices. By regularly shutting them down and using energy-saving settings, we can save a lot of energy. This simple practice not only conserves power but also extends the lifespan of our devices and helps reduce our environmental footprint.
